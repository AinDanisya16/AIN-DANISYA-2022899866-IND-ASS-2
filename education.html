<h3>My Education</h3>

<h4>Primary School</h4>

<h5>Sekolah Kebangsaan Zainab 1</h5>

<p> My primary school is situated in Telipot. It takes only 8 minutes to reach there by car. The primary reason for choosing this school is the fact that my friend from kindergarten also attends here.</p>

<h4>High School</h4>

<h5>Maahad Pengajian Islam</h5>

<p> I have attended two high schools. The initial one was Maahad Pengajian Islam, commonly referred to as MPI. Situated on Jalan Long Yunus, I stayed there until completing Form 3.</p>

<h5>MRSM Kuala Terengganu</h5>

<p>I opted to switch high schools due to my excellent PT3 results. I was selected to complete the remaining years of high school at MRSM Kuala Terengganu, a boarding school. Initially, I felt a bit apprehensive, but it evolved into the setting for my most unforgettable experiences and meaningful friendships.</p>

<h4>University</h4>

<h5>UiTM Dengkil</h5>

<p> After completing my SPM, I received an offer to pursue my studies in the Foundation in Law program at UiTM Dengkil for a year. Unfortunately, I couldn't attend in person due to the ongoing COVID-19 situation. Despite not being able to physically be there, I frequently explore the beauty of the campus online and hope to visit in person one day.</p>

<h5>UiTM Kampus Kota Bharu</h5>

<p>Following the completion of my Foundation in Law, I received an opportunity to advance my academic pursuits in the Bachelor of Business Administration (Hons) with a focus on Business Economics. Initially, I felt a sense of disappointment as my first choice in UPU was to continue my journey in law. However, as I delved into this course, my appreciation for Economics grew, and I now find myself joyfully embracing the opportunity to further my studies in this field. I am currently on my 3rd semester now !</p>
