  <h3>My Experience</h3>

  <h3>2019</h3>

  <p>I have been employed at my father's pharmacy since the age of 16, and honestly, it was quite challenging. During that period, I still perceived myself merely as a teenager rather than an employee at his pharmacy. I wasn't particularly keen on delving into the field of medicine, and I struggled with being attentive to people. Consequently, I found myself feeling a bit awkward when customers inquired about medications, unsure of how to effectively convey information about their usage.

  Over time, however, my interest in medicine has grown, and I now enjoy learning about it. I find fulfillment in assisting people in discovering solutions for their health issues. I continue to contribute to my father's pharmacy, and I am still actively involved in the business to this day!</p>
